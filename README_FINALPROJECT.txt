Before running the program, put your daily steps in an excel file named distance.csv (I have provided an example file)
To run the program, call the function animateDistance in the command window
A pop up window will appear and the user can interact with the GUIs
Choose your unit and the graphs will change accordingly on the y-axis
Click on the animate button to see all the graphs of the 7 days. The program will automatically change the graph so you won't have to press anything 
You can also go between the graphs manually by clicking or sliding on the scroll bar
